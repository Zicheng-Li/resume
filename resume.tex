\hspace{0.1cm} $\bullet$ My team and I developed a graphic calculator called "Math Helper" one day during the hackathon. \\
\hspace{0.1cm} $\bullet$ It is designed to assist students in learning calculus by providing an easy-to-use GUI interface created by Java's Swing framework.\\ 
\hspace{0.1cm} $\bullet$ Users can easily use the calculator for graphing, zooming in, and zooming out. They can also use the quiz mode we prepared to enhance their learning experience.  \\\\
\textbf{Connect Four}  \hfill \href{https://github.com/Zicheng-Li/Connect_Four}{Link to Github} \\
\hspace{0.1cm} $\bullet$ A Connect Four game coded in Java. Players have the option to play against another player or an AI opponent. They can also choose to watch an AI versus AI match. \\\\
\textbf{Spy Network}  \hfill \href{https://github.com/Zicheng-Li/Spy_Network_Framework}{Link to Github} \\
\hspace{0.1cm} $\bullet$ I have designed a spy network utilizing a combination of design patterns including the Observer pattern, Strategy pattern, Singleton pattern, and Decorator pattern.\\
\hspace{0.1cm} $\bullet$ The purpose of this network is to propagate encryption schemes, allowing spies to communicate securely with one another. Please refer to Github for more details.
